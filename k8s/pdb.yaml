# PodDisruptionBudget configuration for customer-facing and customer-management
# Ensures high availability during voluntary disruptions (node drains, upgrades)
# maxUnavailable: 1 means "at most 1 pod can be unavailable during disruption"
# This is clearer than minAvailable and scales better with autoscaling
